# Horizon
A Kinect for Windows game made in Unity.  Current version is an alpha, made over the course of a week for NASA Space Apps Challenge event that we held at the Microsoft offices in NYC (4/11-4/12).

[Download for playable alpha](https://github.com/jasonrwalters/horizon/archive/master.zip)

# How to Play
* Pretend you are holding an invisible plane yoke with two hands.

* Push forward to dive / Pull back to lift.
* Tilt/turn to turn.

* Fly into space to destroy asteroids and collect minerals for your mission (arbitrary/random values for now).
* Fly along the planet surface to collect oxygen and fuel.  Oxygen starts to deplete when you leave the atmosphere.  Fuel always depletes.
