# Horizon
A Kinect for Windows game made in Unity.  Current version is alpha, made over the course of a week for NASA Space Apps Challenge event that we held at the Microsoft offices in NYC (4/11-4/12).  I'm currently working on making this a much larger experience, adding some narrative, mission objectives, and much more.  Enjoy.

# Requirements
* Windows 8.1+
* (1) Kinect v2 sensor.  Without - the game ends after 5 seconds...building proper control toggle in later versions.

# How to Play
* Pretend you are holding an invisible plane yoke with two hands.

* Push forward to dive / Pull back to lift.
* Tilt/turn to turn.

* Fly into space to destroy asteroids and collect minerals for your mission (arbitrary/random values for now).
* Fly along the planet surface to collect oxygen and fuel.  Oxygen starts to deplete when you leave the atmosphere.  Fuel always depletes.
